# Rust in an Hour

## What is this?

Rust in an hour is a small Rust introduction for people with zero knowledge and almost no time. It can be held at user groups and other small events.

It should give enough info to understand the general why and how of Rust, but not go into details at all too many things.

## Structure

Rust in an hour provides:

* A course text that you can use to rehearse
* A slide deck to present
* Talking points for Q&A
* Shell tooling to quickly get an example running in a console

## Suggestions

Some ideas on where to use this course:

* Give it in a second room while the main talk is ongoing. Completely fresh people cannot follow the main talk anyways.
* Give it as an introduction to hack fests and learners groups.
* Use it inside you company to explain Rust to your colleagues.
